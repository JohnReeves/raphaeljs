{"name":"Raphaeljs","tagline":"raphaeljs worksheets published on io","body":"#Starting\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/zK4xZhV.png)\r\n\r\nOpen JSFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net in a new tab (right click on the link - open in new tab)\r\n\r\n#2. Using Raphael\r\n\r\nWe're going to be using a library to help us do all our drawing. If you look at the top left of JSFiddle there should be a drop down of libraries you can use - you might need to look carefully to find RaphaelJS 2.1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Bv0hFD2.png)\r\n\r\n#3. Drawing a Circle\r\n\r\nTo begin drawing we first need to create ourselves a piece of paper:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar paper = Raphael(0, 0, 700, 700);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then begin to draw our shapes on it - we're going to eventually have 9 emojis in a 3 by 3 grid - so don't make them too big!\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar faceShape = paper.circle(100, 100, 70);\r\nfaceShape.attr(\"fill\", \"#cc0000\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote here - we can also change all of the same attributes like we could with SVG - for example here I'm changing the background colour to red.\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/v1Q7dsv.png)\r\n\r\n#4. Custom Objects\r\n\r\nWe already have two variables; `paper` which is the name for where we're drawing on, and `faceShape` which is the name for the shape that represents the circle. \r\n\r\nWe're going to now create an object to hold all the attributes associated with our emoji - this way we can then generate lots of them in future without changing our code.\r\n\r\nStart by creating an object:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar emojiObject = {\r\n  'fill': '#ffcc00'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then use this for our `faceCircle` fill value like this :\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfaceShape.attr(\"fill\", emojiObject.fill);\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/i7qyJ82.png)\r\n\r\n#5 More Properties\r\n\r\nWe can add more properties into our `emoji` object like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar emojiObject = {\r\n  'fill': '#ffcc00',\r\n  'cx':100,\r\n  'cy':100\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use them like :\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar faceShape = paper.circle(emojiObject.cx, emojiObject.cy, 70);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also added in another property for `eyeColour` and drawn into two eye circles. To add the eyes in the correct place you need to do a little math to calculate their location e.g. left eye is further left than cx (decrease x value) and higher than cy (decrease y value).  e.g.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar eyeLeft = paper.circle(emojiObject.cx - 25, emojiObject.cy - 15, 5);\r\neyeLeft.attr(\"fill\", emojiObject.eyeColour);\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9mQHzFS.png)\r\n\r\n#6 Even More Properties\r\n\r\nWe can also set up specific things for properties - for example how happy our emoji might be:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar emojiObject = {\r\n  'fill': '#ffcc00',\r\n  'cx':100,\r\n  'cy':100,\r\n  'happiness':'happy'\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then draw a smile using a path - again using some math to calculate where the smile should start by using the cx and cy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar mouthX = emojiObject.cx - 30;\r\nvar mouthY = emojiObject.cy + 30;\r\n\r\nvar mouth = paper.path(\"M \" + mouthX + \",\" + mouthY + \"q 30,15 60,0\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WNCQkeZ.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNext we need to add some logic to determine if the emoji is actually happy - we can do this by using an if statement:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nif (emojiObject.happiness == \"happy\"){\r\n  //make a happy face here\r\n} else if (emojiObject.happiness == \"unhappy\"){\r\n  //make an unhappy face here \r\n} else {\r\n  //make a confused face here\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this :\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/7w9snl9.png)\r\n\r\n#7 Finishing\r\n\r\nBefore you move onto the next worksheet your emoji should have at least **5 things** that you can change with variables.\r\n\r\n:star: When you've finished - don't forget to save your JSFiddle and send us your link above. :star2:\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
